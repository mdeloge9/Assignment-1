## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r load packages, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggspatial)
library(ggthemes)
```
```{r}
FireStations <- st_read("Fire Stations.kml")
OpenSpace <- st_read("Open Space.shp.zip")
```
```{r}
ggplot() +
  annotation_map_tile(zoomin = 0, progress = "none", type = "stamenbw")  +
  labs(caption = "Map tiles by Stamen Design. Data by OpenStreetMap") +
geom_sf(data = OpenSpace, color = "green") +
  geom_sf(data = FireStations, shape = 23, color = "firebrick", size = 5)
```

 ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = historic, color = NA, alpha = 0.5,
          aes(fill = "Historic District")) +
  geom_sf(data = playgrounds) +
  geom_sf(data = gardens, color = "green") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = "blue", name = "")
